# Motion Generation

Motion generation is the first step in training a Duck Droid. This process creates a diverse set of reference motions that serve as the foundation for learning complex behaviors.

## Overview

Our motion generation system uses advanced algorithms to create natural, physically plausible movements that the droid can learn to imitate and improve upon.

## How It Works

The motion generation process involves several key steps:

1. Define motion parameters and constraints
2. Generate initial motion trajectories
3. Optimize for physical feasibility
4. Validate against real-world constraints

## Examples

Here are some example motions that can be generated:

- Walking gaits
- Turning maneuvers
- Balance recovery
- Obstacle navigation

## Key Concepts

- Motion planning and optimization
- Physical constraints and feasibility
- Natural movement patterns
- Trajectory generation
