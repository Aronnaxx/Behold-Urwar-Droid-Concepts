# Mujoco Playground

The Mujoco Playground provides a realistic simulation environment for testing and visualizing trained models. It allows you to interact with the droid and observe its behavior in real-time.

## Overview

The playground is an interactive environment where you can test, debug, and visualize your trained models in a physics-accurate simulation.

## How It Works

The playground features:

- Real-time physics simulation
- Interactive controls
- Performance metrics
- Visual debugging tools

## Examples

You can use the playground to:

- Test trained models
- Analyze performance
- Debug behaviors
- Record demonstrations

## Key Concepts

- Physics simulation
- Real-time visualization
- Performance analysis
- Interactive testing
