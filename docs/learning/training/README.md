# Training Process

The training process uses reinforcement learning to teach the Duck Droid complex behaviors. This phase builds upon the reference motions generated earlier to create a robust control policy.

## Overview

Training involves teaching the droid to perform complex tasks through trial and error, using reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize its behavior.

## How It Works

Training involves several key components:

1. Setting up the training environment
2. Defining reward functions
3. Running parallel training episodes
4. Optimizing the policy network

## Examples

Training scenarios include:

- Learning to walk on various terrains
- Adapting to different payloads
- Recovering from disturbances
- Following complex paths

## Key Concepts

- Reinforcement learning
- Policy optimization
- Reward shaping
- Environment simulation
